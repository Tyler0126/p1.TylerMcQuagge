<p>The following pictures are photos taken of the interface of my microwave at my apartment.</p>

<p>This first picture is just a basic image of the user interface of the microwave. It shows the time when it is not in use.</p>

<p>This second image is a picture of the microwave user interface whenever you press the Time Cook button. You can see that it says TIME in the digital part of the UI. It then waits until the user enters a desired time to cook their food and then the user must press start. The microwave then starts heating up the food.</p>

<p>This third picture is a picture of the microwace user interface whenever you press the Time On/Off button. When this button is first pressed, it displays what you see there in the picture. It then waits for the user to enter a time and then the user presses the button again. After this button is pressed the second time it starts a timer, but it does not start the actual microwave from heating anything up.</p>

<p>Finally, the following is a gif of the control interface of the microwave in operation. I simply input one minute of cook time for the microwave and am pressing start, which in turn makes the microwave start cooking for a single minute.</p>

<h4>Issues With Current Design</h4>
<p>There are a couple of issues with the current design of this microwave. This first issue I can think of is that whenever you press the Time Cook button, it displays a message in the digital screen that says TIME. Whenever you also press the Time On/Off button, this same message is displayed on the digital screen of the microwave. Having both of these buttons display the same exact message even though they perform completely different functions could be a little confusing.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of the Popcorn, Potato, Beverage, and Reheat buttons at the top of the microwave as shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/IMG_40131111.jpg" style="width:500px;height:550px;">
<p>These buttons are featured at the top of the microwave which makes them seem like they should be really important and frequently used buttons, but I hardly ever use these buttons at all. I feel like it may just be personal to me, but this seems like a big design flaw that there are buttons that I hardly ever use and they are at the very top of the control interface.</p>

<p>One more design flaw that has caused issues for me is the location of the clock and AM/PM buttons pictured below.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/IMG_4013Clock.jpg" alt="basic_microwave_ui" style="width:500px;height:550px;">
<p>The clock button works by letting the user select the time on the microwave once the clock button is pressed. When the user selects the clock button, they can input a time using the numbers and then they are required to enter if it is AM or PM using the AM/PM button. The first time I manually set the time on my microwave, I was confused as to where the AM/PM button was because it was no where near the clock button. This does not make sense to me, and I feel like the Clock and AM/PM buttons should be right next to eachother in the control interface.</p>

<h4>Common and Rare Uses</h4>
<p>There are a couple of uses of the microwave that I use way more often than other times. One of the most common ways I use this microwave is by manually selecting the Time Cook button and then inputting the exact time I want to cook my food for. The second most common way I use my microwave is whenever I am cooking food in my oven, I will utilize the timer on the microwave to keep track of how long I need to cook my food.</p>
<p>Some of the rarer ways I use this microwave is to defrost frozen chicken before I cook with it, setting the time on the microwave whenever daylight savings happens or the power goes out, and to cook popcorn in the microwave.</p>
<p>I believe this control interface makes doing the most common things pretty easy and intuitive, and I have not had any issues with the tasks of the microwave I use the most. The most common sequence of action is that I walk up to the microwave, open up the door, and put my food in and close the door. Then I will push Time Cook and manually enter the amount of time I want my food to cook using the number buttons on the control interface. Once I have my time inputted in, I click the Start button to begin cooking my food.</p>
<p>The microwave provides feedback to the user in a couple different ways. When the user selects a button, it shows an appropriate message on the digital portion of the control interface corresponding to the button that was pressed. Also, whenever the timer has couunted down to zero, the microwave makes a beeping sound to let the user know that the time has expired and the food is done cooking.</p>
<p>Some common mistakes I can make with the current design of the microwave is going up and immediatley typing in the amount of time I want the food to cook in the microwave before pressing the Time Cook button. Doing this just immediately implements the express cook feature and starts cooking my food for however many minutes based on which number I pressed on the control interface. Another common mistake I make when using the microwave's control interface is that I will sometimes mean to press Time Cook to heat my food up and I will accidentally press the Timer button just because they are similarly labeled. This usually only happens whenever I am in a rush and am not paying that good of attention.</p>

<p>The following picture is a sketch I made of an improved control interface for my microwave.</p>

<p>I did not change it up too much because I beleive the control interface is decent enough, but there are still some slight changes. The first change I made is that I moved those 4 buttons at the top that I mentioned earlier to the bottom of the interface because I feel like most people will really not use those buttons very often. Another change I made is that whenever the Timer button is pressed, instead of displaying the TIME message it will now display a TIMER message. This slight change will hopefully help in reducing confusion. Lastly, it made absolutely no sense to me that the AM/PM and clock buttons were not right next to eachother, so I moved these buttons to be next to one another. Other than that, I beleive this microwave's control interface is actually pretty intuitively designed and I did not see the need for any other changes. </p>
